description: Use when reviewing Go code against Rob Pike's Go Proverbs. Activates on explicit request ("review with Go proverbs", "/rob-pike-review") or whenever the user asks to review `.go` files. Flags violations and groups findings by proverb, each tied to a detailed rule file in `proverbs/`.

# Go Proverbs Review

Code review skill based on Rob Pike's 19 Go Proverbs (<https://go-proverbs.github.io/>), delivered as a short mapping from each proverb to a detailed rule file under `proverbs/`.

## When to use

- User explicitly asks for a "Go proverbs review" or types `/rob-pike-review`
- User asks to review Go (`.go`) code — apply all `actionable` proverbs
- User asks about a specific proverb — load the matching file directly

## How to use

Reviews run as a **parallel fan-out of subagents**, one per actionable proverb. This keeps the main context small and each check focused on a single principle.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before any subagent fan-out**, ASK the user which model to use for the per-proverb subagents: `opus` (highest quality, slowest), `sonnet` (balanced), or `haiku` (cheapest, fastest). Wait for their answer — do not pick for them. Pass the chosen model name to every dispatched subagent via the Task tool's `model` parameter.
>
> Skip this step only for the *Single-proverb question* flow below — it loads one file directly in the main thread, no subagents.

### Full review

1. Identify the Go files in scope and hold only their paths in the main thread.
2. For each `actionable` proverb in the index, dispatch a subagent with:
   - The proverb number, short title, and path to `proverbs/NN-*.md`
   - The list of `.go` file paths to review
   - Instruction: load only that one rule file, read the code, return findings in the format `<file>:<line> — <one-sentence observation>` or the literal string `no findings`
3. Dispatch all subagents **in parallel** (single message, multiple tool calls).
4. For `tooling` proverbs, dispatch a single subagent that verifies the tool is configured (e.g. `golangci-lint` config present) and returns pass/fail — no code findings.
5. Skip `philosophical` and `postponed` proverbs entirely — they inform judgment, not findings.
6. Aggregate all subagent results, group by proverb, and produce the final report (see *Output format*).

### Partial review

If the user asks to check against specific proverbs ("review for #4 and #15 only"), dispatch only those subagents. Same fan-out pattern, smaller set.

### Single-proverb question

If the user asks about one proverb specifically ("explain #8" / "does this code violate #13?"), skip the subagent fan-out: load the single rule file directly in the main thread and answer.

### Why this pattern

- Main context never holds more than one or two rule files at a time
- Each subagent reasons about exactly one principle — fewer false positives
- Parallel execution keeps wall-clock time low
- The user can always ask for a partial review to narrow scope further

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `actionable` | Generates findings during review |
| `tooling` | Verify the tool is wired up, don't flag code |
| `philosophical` | Informs judgment, no findings emitted |

## Output format

Group findings under each violated proverb:

```
### Proverb #N — <short title>
- path/to/file.go:42 — <one-sentence finding>
- path/to/file.go:87 — <one-sentence finding>
  See: proverbs/NN-<slug>.md
```

End the review with a summary line: total findings, number of distinct proverbs violated, files touched.
